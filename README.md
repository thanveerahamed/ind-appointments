# IND Appointments

### TL;DR;
This message is for folks who are trying to get the best appointment slots for their Biometric or Doc collection.

I had this difficulty when I was looking for appointments for the same. Finding an appointment for the dates you like is very stressful. It is very difficult to know if any new slots might open up. Possible chance you may miss the opportunity to get an earlier date. Keeping this in mind one weekend I randomly decided to build an application that can help me. It was easier to write a python script, but not everyone has the expertise to run the script. So I built a web application. This application gives you the following benefits:
- Book the appointment on the earliest possible date.
- Select more than one location at once.
- Book an appointment with ease for one or more people.
- Let the application do the work for you. You can schedule a timer, which will query for appointments every 5 to 45 minutes, and book a slot as soon as one is available.

I wish it helps everyone. ðŸ™‚ I will be improving the website regularly.

P.S: the preferred device to access would be a computer or laptop. But works OK with mobile.
